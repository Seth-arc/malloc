## Integration and Maintenance Strategy

The documentation framework I've outlined represents a comprehensive system where each document serves specific purposes while connecting to support the overall project success. Think of this documentation as creating a feedback system that learns and improves continuously.

The key to successful implementation is understanding that documentation isn't just administrative overheadâ€”it's the institutional memory and communication system that allows complex VR projects to succeed. Each document captures knowledge that would otherwise exist only in team members' heads, making it available when needed and preventing the loss of valuable insights.

Start with the foundational documents from Phase 0 and Phase 1, as these establish the standards and procedures that all other documentation references. Then build out the documentation for phases where your team is currently working, expanding the documentation framework as your project grows in scope and complexity.

The maintenance requirements I've specified for each document ensure that documentation remains current and valuable rather than becoming outdated reference material that misleads rather than helps development efforts.
