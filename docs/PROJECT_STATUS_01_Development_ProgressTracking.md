## Project Focus \& Educational Mission

### Primary Focus: "Pedagogy First" Development Philosophy

Every technical decision serves the ultimate goal of creating measurable, effective learning outcomes through immersive VR experiences. This system transforms educational content creation from an art into a science by:

- **Embodied Cognition Implementation**: 4-level embodiment system supporting kinesthetic learning
- **Adaptive Learning Integration**: Real-time personalization based on learner profiles and performance
- **Spatial Precision Requirement**: Sub-millimeter accuracy (¬±0.1mm) for educational object relationships
- **Quest 3 Optimization Priority**: Maintaining 72-90 FPS while preserving educational effectiveness
- **Universal Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance with inclusive design principles


### Educational Impact Targets

- **Learning Effectiveness**: Minimum 80% learning objective achievement rate
- **Engagement Maintenance**: Sustained 70%+ engagement throughout VR sessions
- **Knowledge Retention**: 75%+ retention rates measured through post-experience assessments
- **Accessibility Compliance**: 100% compliance with educational accessibility standards

## Constraint-Driven Development Priorities

### Priority 1: Educational Effectiveness Preservation

All optimization decisions must prioritize learning effectiveness over pure performance gains. When conflicts arise between technical optimization and educational value, educational effectiveness takes precedence.

**Implementation Guidance:**

- Performance optimizations must include educational impact assessments
- Feature removals require educational effectiveness validation
- User experience changes must maintain pedagogical alignment
- Code refactoring must preserve educational context and metadata


### Priority 2: Quest 3 Performance Compliance

Maintain minimum 72 FPS with target 90 FPS while delivering complex educational VR experiences with sub-millimeter spatial precision.

**Technical Constraints:**

- Maximum 200,000 triangles per frame for complex educational scenes
- Texture memory budget of 512MB for educational content
- Interaction latency under 20ms for educational responsiveness
- Memory usage under 8GB total application footprint


### Priority 3: MCP Protocol Compliance

Strict adherence to Model Context Protocol standards while extending capabilities for educational contexts.

**Protocol Requirements:**

- Full MCP protocol version 2024-11-05 compliance
- Educational extensions properly documented and versioned
- Context management preserving educational metadata
- Error handling following MCP error format specifications


### Priority 4: Enterprise Security \& Privacy

Educational data requires higher privacy protection standards than commercial applications.

**Security Mandates:**

- FERPA compliance for educational records
- COPPA compliance for minors' data protection
- GDPR compliance for international learners
- Educational institution data governance requirements
