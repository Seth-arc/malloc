Project Overview: Malloc VR MCP Learning Architecture
This is a sophisticated VR learning system that integrates with Blender 4.4+ to create adaptive, personalized educational experiences. The system uses a mathematical model to provide real-time learning adaptation within immersive VR environments.
Core Architecture Components
1. Five Learning Models Integration
The system is built around five interconnected models that work together through a mathematical equation:
∩ Learner Model: Comprehensive learner profiles (static demographics + dynamic behavior patterns)
∆ Knowledge Model: Curriculum structure, prerequisites, and content organization
E Engagement Model: Multi-dimensional VR interaction tracking and motivation metrics
A Assessment Model: Formative, authentic, and competency-based evaluation
∂ Transition Model: Decision engine for learning progression through five learning events
2. Mathematical Learning Equation
The core adaptation formula: ∂(t+1) = ∂(t) + α · Δ(∩(t), ∆(t), E(t), A(t)) + β · ε(t)
This equation enables real-time learning adaptation with:
Dynamic weighting that changes based on learning phases
Adaptive learning rates (α) and exploration factors (β)
Stochastic elements for serendipitous learning opportunities
3. Five Progressive Learning Events
The system guides learners through structured progression:
Onboarding → VR comfort and basic interaction establishment
Introduction → Guided concept discovery and exploration
Practice → Skill development through repeated application
Application → Authentic task completion in realistic scenarios
Mastery → Expert-level demonstration and knowledge creation
